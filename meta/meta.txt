Wifi Key Scanner - Connect to WLAN by Camera

# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Tired of typing long passwords to connect to the Wifi? 

# LONG DESCRIPTION

A few days ago I had to type eJ8k2p90Nnd3jrT8Jm as a password to connect to a WiFi - that was annoying.

So I wrote a small but helpful app to scan Wifi passwords, for example written on the back of a router or on a piece of paper. The app does not store any Wifi names or passwords. It simply scans the camera input for text and displays the found passwords to the user.

You can copy the detected password to your clipboard or directly connect to the Wifi via the app. 

I hope you enjoy this app.
